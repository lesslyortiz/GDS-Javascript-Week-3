// EASY: Create two variables and assign a person’s name to each. Console log a statement that says which name is shorter or longer, and by how many characters. Example output: “The name Thomas is longer than John by 2 characters”
var name1= "jane";
var name2 = "doe";
console.log("The name ${name1} is longer than ${name2} by ${name1.length - name2.length} characters");
